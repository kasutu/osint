Sure, here's a simple README for your Python script:

# Facebook Name Search Script

This script reads names from a file, searches for each name on Facebook, and opens the search results in your default browser.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository or download the script.

3. Prepare a text file with the names you want to search for. Each name should be on a separate line.

4. Run the script using the command:

```bash
python hunt.py
```

The script will start searching for the first name in the file. After each search, it will prompt you to press Enter to continue to the next name.

If you want to bypass the pause after each search, you can use the `--bypass-pause` argument:

```bash
python hunt.py --bypass-pause
```

If you want to scrape and save the screenshot of the profile, you can use the `--scrape` argument:

```bash
python hunt.py --scrape
```

With this argument, the script will automatically proceed to the next name without waiting for you to press Enter.

## Note

The progress of the script is saved in a file named `progress.txt`. If the script is interrupted, it can resume from where it left off when you run it again. The `progress.txt` file is deleted at the end of the script.

Please replace `hunt.py` with the actual name of your Python script when running it.
